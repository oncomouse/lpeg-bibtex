  abstract = {Proposals to make us smarter than the greatest geniuses or to add                 thousands of years to our life spans seem fit only for the spam folder or trash can.                 And yet this is what contemporary advocates of radical enhancement offer in all                 seriousness. They present a variety of technologies and therapies that will expand                 our capacities far beyond what is currently possible for human beings. In                 Humanity's End, Nicholas Agar argues against radical enhancement,                 describing its destructive consequences. Agar examines the                 proposals of four prominent radical enhancers: Ray Kurzweil, who argues that                 technology will enable our escape from human biology; Aubrey de Grey, who calls for                 anti-aging therapies that will achieve "longevity escape velocity"; Nick                 Bostrom, who defends the morality and rationality of enhancement; and James Hughes,                 who envisions a harmonious democracy of the enhanced and the unenhanced. Agar argues                 that the outcomes of radical enhancement could be darker than the rosy futures                 described by these thinkers. The most dramatic means of enhancing our cognitive                 powers could in fact kill us; the radical extension of our life span could eliminate                 experiences of great value from our lives; and a situation in which some humans are                 radically enhanced and others are not could lead to tyranny of posthumans over                 humans.},

  abstract = {The transformative potential of genetic and cybernetic technologies to                 enhance human capabilities is most often either rejected on moral and prudential                 grounds or hailed as the future salvation of humanity. In this book, Nicholas Agar                 offers a more nuanced view, making a case for moderate human enhancement --                 improvements to attributes and abilities that do not significantly exceed what is                 currently possible for human beings. He argues against radical human enhancement, or                 improvements that greatly exceed current human capabilities. Agar explores notions                 of transformative change and motives for human enhancement; distinguishes between                 the instrumental and intrinsic value of enhancements; argues that too much                 enhancement undermines human identity; considers the possibility of cognitively                 enhanced scientists; and argues against radical life extension. Making the case for                 moderate enhancement, Agar argues that many objections to enhancement are better                 understood as directed at the degree of enhancement rather than enhancement itself.                 Moderate human enhancement meets the requirement of truly human                 enhancement. By radically enhancing human cognitive capabilities, by contrast, we                 may inadvertently create beings ("post-persons") with moral status higher                 than that of persons. If we create beings more entitled to benefits and protections                 against harms than persons, Agar writes, this will be bad news for the unenhanced.                 Moderate human enhancement offers a more appealing vision of the future and of our                 relationship to technology.},
